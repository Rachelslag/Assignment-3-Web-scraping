Amis people,"Nationally Recognized Locally recognized Unrecognized The Amis (Amis: Amis, Ami, Pangcah; Paiwan: Muqami), also known as the Pangcah (which means 'people' and 'kinsmen'), are an indigenous Austronesian ethnic group native to Taiwan. They speak the Amis language (Caciyaw no Pangcah; Minuqamian), an Austronesian language, and are one of the sixteen officially recognized Taiwanese indigenous peoples. The traditional territory of the Amis includes the long, narrow valley between the Central Mountains and the Coastal Mountains (Huadong Valley), the Pacific coastal plain eastern to the Coastal Mountains and the Hengchun Peninsula. In 2014, the Amis numbered 200,604.[1] This was approximately 37.1% of Taiwan's total indigenous population, making them the largest indigenous group.[2] The Amis are primarily fishermen due to their coastal location. They traditionally had a matrilineal kinship system, by which inheritance and property pass through the maternal line, and children are considered born to the mother's people.[3] Traditional Amis villages were relatively large for Taiwanese indigenous communities, typically holding between 500 and 1,000 people. In today's Taiwan, the Amis also comprise the majority of ""urban indigenous people"" and have developed many urban communities all around the island. In recent decades, Amis have also married exogamously to the Han as well as other indigenous peoples.[4] The Amis people refer to themselves by two different ethnonyms. While those living in the East Rift Valley and Hualien County generally identify as Pangcah, which means ""human"" or ""people of our kind,"" Amis living in coastal Taitung County employ the term Amis. Perhaps because of the official name, in 21st-century Taiwan, the term Amis is much more frequently used. This name comes from the word 'amis, meaning ""north."" There is still no consensus in the academic circle as to how ""'Amis"" came to be used to address the Pangcah. It may originally have been a term used by the Puyuma to refer to the Pangcah, who lived to the north of them. Another theory is that those who lived in the Taitung Plain called themselves ""'Amis"" because their ancestors had come from the north.  This later explanation is recorded in the Banzoku Chōsa Hōkokusho,[5] indicating this term may have originated from a group classified by anthropologists as Falangaw Amis, the Amis group occupying territory from today's Chengkung to the Taitung Plain. Their closest genetic relatives appear to be the native Filipino people.[6][7] According to Taiwanese Aboriginal History: Amis, the Amis are classified into five groups: Such classification, however widely accepted, is based simply on the geographical distribution and ethnic migration. It does not correspond to observed differences in culture, language, and physiques. The People's Republic of China (PRC), which claims Taiwan as part of its own territory, considers all of the Amis as part of a Gaoshan ethnic group, one of the 56 ethnic groups of the PRC. A genetic study showed that Austronesian speakers such as the Ami and Atayal of Taiwan, and Kankanaey of Philippines have significant ancestry (67% to 74%) related to Neolithic Fujian source. That Neolithic Fujian source is also estimated to contribute between 35% and 40% of Han Chinese ancestry in Guangdong and Fujian.[8] Family affairs, including finance of the family, are decided by the female householder, in the Amis tradition. The most important traditional ceremony is the Harvest Festival. The Amis Harvest Festival is held to express the people's thanks and appreciation to the gods, and to pray for harvest in the next coming year. It takes place every July to September.[9] Traditional Amis clothes were made with cloth knitted with bark and banana threads with bamboo needles, and used wear-resistant linens and pelts. This evolved during the 20th Century with the arrival of cotton, acquired by the Amis through barter, which progressively phased out the use of traditional material in favor of cotton. There are two clothing styles: Hualien and Taitung. Both use a head scarf, chest covering and a skirt. Chiefs and priests, on the other hand, wear robes and rattan headgear, to distinguish themselves. They also have an ‘alufo’ (“lover’s bag”), made with betel nut by their mother or their lover, which is both used in everyday life and during rituals. It is traditionally used to carry betel nut, limestone, betel and smoking pipes. Traditionally black, Amis clothing has evolved during the 20th century to using more and more red, “for its perceived festiveness and compatibility with ethno-tourism”.[10] The coloring of necklaces distinguishes different Amis communities. Floral headdresses are also often used during special occasions, such as the harvest. The musical project Enigma used an Amis chant in their song ""Return to Innocence"", on their second album, The Cross of Changes (1993). This song was used as the theme song of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. The main chorus was sung by Difang and Igay Duana, who were part of a Taiwanese aboriginal cultural performance group. Maison des Cultures du Monde had earlier recorded the singing of this group while on tour, and released a CD. This song was subsequently used by Enigma (although they did not note the ethnic origin of the song and the singers). The recording studio and the Taiwanese group filed a suit for copyright infringement, which was later settled by Enigma out of court. Ami singing is known for its complex contrapuntal polyphony.","This page was last edited on 5 December 2024, at 17:52 (UTC)."
Atayal people,"The Atayal (Chinese: 泰雅; pinyin: Tàiyǎ), also known as the Tayal and the Tayan,[1] are a Taiwanese indigenous people. The Atayal people number around 90,000, approximately 15.9% of Taiwan's total indigenous population, making them the third-largest indigenous group.[2][3] The preferred endonym is ""Tayal""[citation needed], although official English translations of documents supplied by the Taiwanese government name them as ""Atayal"".[4] The Atayal word for Atayal is tayal, meaning ""human"" or ""man"".[5]The word the people use to refer to themselves is Tayal, almost never Atayal. The first record of Atayal inhabitance is found near the upper reaches of the Zhuoshui River. During the late 17th century, they crossed the Central Mountain Ranges into the wilderness of the east. They then settled in the Liwu River valley. Seventy-nine Atayal villages can be found here. [citation needed] Taiwan has been home to a number of Austronesian indigenous groups since before 4,000 BC.[6]  However, genetic analysis suggests that the different peoples may have different ancestral source populations originating in mainland Asia, and developed in isolation from each other.  The Atayal people are believed to have migrated to Taiwan from Southern China or Southeast Asia.[7] Genetic studies have also found similarities between the Atayal and other people in the Philippines and Thailand, and to a lesser extent with south China and Vietnam.[8] The Atayal are genetically distinct from the Amis people, who are the largest indigenous group in Taiwan, as well as from the Han people, suggesting little mingling between these people.[9] Studies on Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymorphisms suggest ancient migrations of two lineages of the various peoples into Taiwan approximately 11,000–26,000 years ago.[10] Recent DNA studies show that the Lapita people and modern Polynesians have a common ancestry with the Atayal and the Kankanaey people of the northern Philippines.[11] The Atayal are visibly different from the Han Chinese of Taiwan.[12] According to stories told by their elders, the first Atayal ancestors appeared when a stone, Pinspkan, cracked apart. There were three people, but one decided to go back into the stone. One man and one woman who lived together for a very long time and loved each other very much. But the boy was shy and wouldn't dare approach her. Whereupon, the girl came up with an idea. She left her home and found some coal with which to blacken her face so she could pose as a different girl. After several days, she crept back into their home and the boy mistook her for another girl and they lived happily together. Not long after, the couple bore children, fulfilling their mission of procreating the next generation. The Atayal custom of face tattooing may have come from the girl blackening her face in the story. The Atayal people have a distinct culture. They traditionally lived by fishing, hunting, gathering, and growing crops on burned-off mountain fields. The Atayal also traditionally practice crafts such as weaving, net knotting, and woodworking. They also have culturally specific musical instruments and dances. The Atayal were known as skilled warriors. In a practice illegal since the Japanese Colonial Era (1895–1945), for a man to earn his facial tattoo, he  had to bring back at least one human head; these heads, or skulls, were highly honored, given food and drink, and expected to bring good harvests to the fields. (See Headhunting.) The Atayal are also known for the case of the Wushe Incident, in which the Atayal participated in an uprising against colonial Japanese forces. The Lalaw Behuw, a type of long knife, was a weapon used by the Atayals.[13][14][15] The Atayal are proficient weavers, incorporating symbolic patterns and designs on their traditional dress. The features are mainly of geometric style, and the colors are bright and dazzling. Most of the designs are argyles and horizontal lines. In Atayal culture, the horizontal lines represent the rainbow bridge which leads the dead to where the ancestors' spirits live. Argyles, on the other hand, represent ancestors' eyes protecting the Atayal. The favorite color of this culture is red because it represents blood and power. The Atayal people are also known for using facial tattooing and teeth filing in coming-of-age initiation rituals.  The facial tattoo, in Squliq Tayal, is called ptasan. In the past both men and women had to show that they had performed a major task associated with adulthood before their faces could be tattooed. For a man, he had to take the head of an enemy, showing his valor as a hunter to protect and provide for his people, while women had to be able to weave cloth. A girl would learn to weave when she was about ten or twelve, and she had to master the skill in order to earn her tattoo. Only those with tattoos could marry, and, after death, only those with tattoos could cross the hongu utux, or spirit bridge (the rainbow) to the hereafter. Male tattooing is relatively simple, with only two bands down the forehead and chin. Once a male came of age he would have his forehead tattooed; after fathering a child, his bottom chin was tattooed. For the female, tattooing was done on the cheek, typically from the ears across both cheeks to the lips forming a V shape. While tattooing on a man is relatively quick, on a female it may take up to ten hours.[7] Tattooing was performed only by female tattooists. The tattooing was performed using a group of needles lashed to a stick called atok tapped into the skin using a hammer called totsin. Black ash would then be rubbed into the skin to create the tattoo.  Healing could take up to a month.[7] The Japanese banned the practice of tattooing in 1930 because of its association with headhunting. With the introduction of Christianity, the practice declined, and tattoos were only seen on the elderly. However, some young people in recent years have attempted to revive the practice.[7] By 2018 only one tattooed elder survived, Lawa Piheg, who was tattooed when she was 8.[16] Lawa Piheg died on 14 September 2019.[17][18] The Atayal people in Taiwan live in central and northern Taiwan. The northernmost village is in Ulay District (Wulai in Chinese), about 25 kilometers south of Taipei. The Atayal Tribe The community of Smangus in Jianshi Township had become well known as a tourist destination, and an experiment in communalism.[19] Many Atayal are bilingual, but the Atayal language still remains in active use.","This page was last edited on 7 December 2024, at 07:48 (UTC)."
Bunun people,"The Bunun (Bunun: Bunun), also historically known as the Vonum,[1] are a Taiwanese indigenous people. They speak the Bunun language. Unlike other aboriginal peoples in Taiwan, the Bunun are widely dispersed across the island's central mountain ranges. In the year 2000, the Bunun numbered 41,038. This was approximately 8% of Taiwan's total indigenous population, making them the fourth-largest indigenous group.[2] They have five distinct communities: the Takbunuaz, the Takituduh, the Takibaka, the Takivatan, and the Isbukun. Until the coming of the Christian missionaries in the beginning of the 20th century, the Bunun were known to be fierce warriors and headhunters. The Bunun were one of the ""high-mountain peoples"" (along with the Atayal and the Taroko) who traditionally lived in small family units in Taiwan's Central Mountain Range and were hostile to all outsiders, whether they be Chinese immigrants or surrounding aboriginal peoples. Whereas most other aborigines were quite sedentary and tended to live in lower areas, the Bunun, along with the Atayal and Taroko were constantly on the move in Taiwan's Central Mountain Range, looking for new hunting grounds and practicing slash-and-burn agriculture. Their staple foods were millet, yam, and game. During the Japanese rule (1895–1945), the Bunun were among the last peoples to be ""pacified"" by the Japanese government in residence. After an initial period of fierce resistance, they were forced to move down from the mountains and concentrated into a number of lowland villages that were spread across the Island. As a result, the family unit became less important and life centred on individual village units. The Japanese government restricted hunting practices (mainly to control the use of firearms) and introduced wet rice cultivation. The Bunun Aboriginals under Chief Raho Ari [zh] (lāhè· āléi) engaged in guerilla warfare against the Japanese for twenty years. Raho Ari's revolt was sparked when the Japanese implemented a gun control policy in 1914 against the Aboriginals in which their rifles were impounded in police stations when hunting expeditions were over. The Dafen Incident [zh] began at Dafen when a police platoon was slaughtered by Raho Ari's clan in 1915. A settlement holding 266 people called Tamaho was created by Raho Ari and his followers near the source of the Laonong River and attracted more Bunun rebels to their cause. Raho Ari and his followers captured bullets and guns and slew Japanese in repeated hit and run raids against Japanese police stations by infiltrating over the Japanese ""guardline"" of electrified fences and police stations as they pleased.[3] Many Bunun were recruited as local policemen and during WWII, the Japanese army had Bunun regiments. In 1941 the Bunun were relocated following the Pasnanavan incident.[4] Throughout the 20th century, several waves of missionaries of various denominations spread across Taiwan. They were particularly successful with the aboriginal inhabitants of the island and after the last missionary wave in the 1940s, that originated in Japan, a majority of aborigines were converted to Christianity. Today, most Bunun either belong to the Catholic Church or to the local Presbyterian Church. After the arrival of the Chinese Nationalist Kuomintang in October 1945, difficult days began for the aboriginal population. The ""one language, one culture"" policy of the Nationalist government prohibited to use of any language other than Standard Mandarin, for official use as well as in daily life, and indigenous cultures were systematically discriminated against and encouraged to assimilate into mainstream culture. Bunun culture was eroded by the joint pressure of their new faith as well as the government's sinification policies. The situation improved only recently after two decades of democratic reforms. Originally, the Bunun people crafted their clothing from animal skins and linen. However, through integration with the Han people, they have started to use materials such as cotton and wool.[5] Men's clothing features an open white vest with vibrant multi-colored geometrical patterns at the opening and on the back.[6] These patterns primarily feature the colors pink, green, yellow, red, and dark blue. Bunun people wear this vest with a short black skirt and a colorful abdominal bag, functioning as a type of undergarment.[5] These clothes are usually worn during the rituals.[6] Another version of men's clothing consists of a knee-length black skirt paired with a black or blue long-sleeved coat with colorful embroidery on the neckline, in the middle of the coat and on the back.[5] Women's clothing includes a long black or blue dress with extended sleeves with embroidery at the sleeve ends and dress placket. Another attire involves a long-sleeved shirt with embroidery at the sleeve ends, collar, shirt placket, and bottom hem. This shirt is paired with a long skirt with a colorful pattern at the bottom hem, and an apron worn over the skirt.[5] The apron has embroidery at the center, left side, and bottom. Another version includes trousers worn under the apron.[7] Additionally, the Bunun people adorn themselves with various ornaments and accessories, such as headbands exclusively worn by males, hats, and necklaces.[8] Most of these accessories are crafted from glass beads or shell pieces.[9] The Pasibutbut is a song of Bunun Sowing Festival, sung polyphonically in four-part harmony (Common 8 heterophonic voice, usually 5-12 heterophonic voices). The Taiwan composer Jin Fong Yang (楊金峯) analyzed the structure of this song. Japanese Musicologist Takatomo Kurosawa (黑澤隆朝) recorded with Bunun musicians in 1943.[10][11] According to Bunun legend, in times long past, two suns shone down upon the earth and made it unbearably hot. A father and a son endured numerous hardships and finally shot down one of the suns, which then became the moon. In its wrath, the moon demanded that father and son would return to their own people to tell them that they henceforth had to obey three commandments or face annihilation. The first was that they had to constantly observe the waxing and waning of the moon and conduct all rituals and work according to its rhythm. The second commandment stated that all Bunun had to conduct rituals throughout their lives to honor the spirits of heaven and earth. The third commandment told them of forbidden behaviours, and forced them to become an orderly and peaceful people. A variant of the story tells that long, long ago, a mother and father went out working in the field and took their newly born son with them. While working, they put the child in a basket at the side of the field, and for a whole day he lay in the unbearable heat of the two suns. When the parents returned in the late afternoon, they found that their son had completely dried up and turned into a black lizard. Stricken by grief, the father took his bow and shot down one of the suns. This story illustrates the importance of the sky in traditional Bunun animist religion. The Bunun assumed that the world in which they lived were full of supernatural beings (qanitu) that were often associated with particular places (trees, rocks, etc.). An important locus of supernatural power was the sky (dihanin/diqanin). All supernatural forces seem to have had a fairly abstract character and it is therefore not really clear whether the sky was a god or just a place in which all kinds of spirits lived. The origin story of the Bunun people's tendency to live in mountainous areas was related by the wife of the American consul general in Yokohama in the following way:[12] According to a tribal legend, the Vonum Group of Formosan mountain savages lived in the plains until the misfortune of an all-destroying deluge befell them. With the flood came a huge serpent, which swam through the stormy waters toward the terrorized people. They owed their deliverance from the great snake to the timely appearance of a monster crab, which, after a terrific battle, succeeded in killing the reptile. - Alice Ballantine Kirjassoff, March 1920 It is certain, however, that the moon was considered to be one of the major spirits, and almost all activities in daily life had to be aligned with the lunar calendar. This could go very far, for instance, in a certain lunar month it was forbidden for women to wash themselves. The Bunun are the only aboriginal people in Taiwan that developed a primitive form of writing to record lunar cycles and their relationship to important events such as the harvest or the slaughter of pigs. The prescriptions related to the lunar calendar are part of a larger system of prescriptions and taboos that used to govern all aspects of Bunun life. Many of these had a ritualistic character and all were part of an age-based pecking order where an absolute obedience to one's elders was demanded. For instance, in order to determine whether a man could go hunting, he had to wait till one of the elders had had a prophetic dream (matibahi). If the dream was good, he could go out hunting. A bad dream indicated that great mishap would befall the hunter if he would go in the woods, and the elders would forbid him to go. Most of these rules got into disuse after the coming of Christianity (which branded them as superstition), but present-day Bunun society has still retained a number of social rituals and still imposes a strong obligation on children to behave in a respectful and obedient way towards anyone that is older than themselves. Taiwan oil millet was one of the staple crops of the Bunun people until their 1941 relocation. In the 21st century Taiwanese oil millet cultivation has been revived.[4] Malahtangia, the ear-shooting festival is a male rite of passage ceremony in Bunun culture. The festival is usually held between March and April, and women are traditionally barred from attending. Before the festival, every adult male would journey to the mountains to hunt. Following a successful hunt, the men would return home and hang the carcasses from wooden frames so that the boys could shoot the dead animals. Those who could shoot a deer's ear were considered especially talented due to its small size. After this ritual, the participating boys were considered adults and could from then on join their brothers and fathers in the hunt. With modern lifestyle changes in Bunun society, the ear-shooting festival has become more of a ritualized performance; though the marksmanship and hunting skills taught through the festival are no longer as relevant, the event is still considered beneficial as it teaches respect for elders and the community at large. According to a study published in 2014, the Y-DNA of the Bunun people belongs mainly to haplogroup O1a2-M50 (34/56 = 60.7%) or haplogroup O2a1a-M88 (21/56 = 37.5%), with a single representative of haplogroup P*-M45(xQ-M242, R-M207) (1/56 = 1.8%).[13] Haplogroup O-M88 is rare among other aboriginal peoples of Taiwan and its vicinity, being found more commonly among populations of southwestern China and the northern parts of Mainland Southeast Asia, such as Tai peoples and Vietnamese.","This page was last edited on 26 November 2024, at 10:03 (UTC)."
Kanakanavu people,"The Kanakanavu (Chinese: 卡那卡那富族; Wade–Giles: Kanakanavu) are an indigenous people of central southern Taiwan. They live in the two villages of Manga and Takanua in Namasia District, Kaohsiung City, Taiwan.[3] The native Kanakanavu speakers were Taiwanese aboriginals living on the islands. Following the Dutch Colonial Period in the 17th century, Han-Chinese immigration began to dominate the islands population. The village of Takanua is a village assembled by Japanese rulers to relocate various aboriginal groups in order to establish easier dominion over these groups.[4] On 26 June 2014, the government recognized Kanakanavu as the 16th group of Taiwanese indigenous peoples.[5] Japanese occupation left evidence of how the culture functioned. Forest clearance allowed agriculture to be the main facet of society, followed by hunting and fishing. Maize, Rice, Millet, Taro, Sweet Potatoes, beans, and soybeans were the staple crops.[2] Kanakanavu practiced a polytheistic nature religion involving offerings, fertility rituals, and shamanism. Headhunting was a common practice until Christianization took over.[6] The traditional attire of the Kanakanavu people encompassed a leather hat and vest crafted from furry deer skin, exposing the chest. Over time, increased trade and interactions with other communities prompted a shift to linen and cotton garments, once the privilege of the affluent. The ensemble is complemented by a range of accessories, such as earrings, wrist ornaments, leather shoes, hunting bags, and headdresses, particularly favored by males. Men from the tribe commonly don a linen-based red corset suspended diagonally from the nape of the neck, featuring a pouch for personal items or tools. Geometric patterns, woven in hues of blue, black, or yellow, adorn the upper section of the corset. The lower body is draped with a rectangular short skirt fashioned from overlapping black cotton layers, secured with a bamboo belt. This belt traditionally accentuates chest muscles, symbolizing prowess in combat or hunting. Signifying social status and achievement, long feathers from eagles and blue-bellied pheasants are integral to their attire, with young males displaying one to four feathers, while elders boast from five to eight. Traditionally, women's attire comprised leather, evolving with changing techniques and trade dynamics to include cotton, silk, or satin for the affluent and linen for others. The upper body is cloaked in a lengthy short top secured with a tied strap at the back or wrapped around the waist. A vibrant array of colors—red, yellow, blue, black, green, and purple—is intricately embroidered on the collar, front edge, hem, and cuffs of the jacket.Completing the ensemble is a black long skirt elegantly draped from left to right around the lower body, tied with a belt. This red or green belt was usually made of cotton or silk and decorated with embroidered patterns. Women could also wear accessories such as earrings, neck ornaments, headscarf, hats decorated with colorful garlands or knee pants during events or ceremonies. 7.

Kavalan people,"The Kavalan (endonym kbalan [kɨβaɾán]; ""people living in the plain""; Chinese: 噶瑪蘭族) or Kuvalan are an indigenous people of Taiwan. Most of them moved to the coastal area of Hualien County and Taitung County in the 19th century due to encroachment by Han settlers. Their language is also known as Kavalan. Currently, the largest settlement of Kavalan is Xinshe (Kavalan: pateRongan) Village in Fengbin Township, Hualien County. Legend has it that the Kavalan arrived by sea from the east and that when they saw the stunning beauty of this location, they decided then and there to settle this bountiful land. The newly arrived Kavalan fought many battles against the local Atayal people, and in the end the Kavalan drove the Atayal into the mountains—true to their name ""Kavalan"", which means ""flatland people"". That name subsequently morphed into ""Hamalan"", ultimately yielding the modern-day Yilan City. They were referred as 36 Kavalan tribes (蛤仔難三十六社), although there were more than 60. In the past, tribes north of the Lanyang River were called Sai-sè-hoan (西勢番) while those south of the river were Tang-sè-hoan (東勢番). The earliest record of the Kavalan in history was in 1632, when a Spanish ship went astray to this area by a typhoon. More clear record came in 1650 by the Dutch East India Company (VOC).  Reportedly, at some point there was a Spanish province of Cabarán in the area. Han Chinese tried to settle in the area as early as 1768. However, settlement did not succeed until 1796, when Ngô͘ Soa [zh] established the first village (now Toucheng). Eventually, many more Han Chinese entered this area and the life of Kavalan was forced to change. Many of them moved to Beipu Village (in Sincheng Township of Hualien County) between 1830 and 1840. In the past, Kavalan`s men sometimes opted for shorter garments or exposing their chests and backs. The Han Chinese influence brought about the introduction of cotton clothing in the Han style.[1] Kavalan people wear traditional clothes only during important traditional performances and ritual practices.[2] These traditional attires of the Kavalan community are unisex and are characterized by simplicity, typically featuring only one or two colors, predominantly black or white, and lack elaborate dyeing and colorful geometric patterns. The upper garments are practically identical for both men and women. The white shirt has a round neck, long sleeves, and a row of Chinese-style buttons in the middle, adorned with black cloth on the front.[1] The lower garment usually consists of a skirt, commonly in black or white.[3] Chiefs, elders, and shamans make an exception to this attire by wearing black pants and black shirt.[4] A crucial element in the crafting of Kavalan clothing is banana fiber. The Kavalan people weave this fiber into hemp fabric, which is then used for creating traditional Kavalan attire, as well as daily necessities and accessories like belts, straw capes, and tote bags, often complementing their traditional clothing.[5] In 1878, the Kavalan, and their Sakizaya allies, fought a devastating battle against Qing invaders after a dispute with Qing officials led to a local uprising.[6] This event ended in disaster for both communities with many of their members slaughtered in the Takobowan incident [zh][7] (also known as the ""Galeewan Incident""[8] or ""Kalyawan Battle"").[9] Others were displaced by Han settlers.[8] The remaining Sakizaya, meanwhile, were forced to blend with other peoples, such as the Amis, with the intention of protecting their identity.[10]","This page was last edited on 26 November 2024, at 10:11 (UTC)."
Paiwan people,"The Paiwan (Paiwan: Kacalisian; Chinese: 排灣; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Pâi-oan; Zhuyin Fuhao: ㄆㄞˊㄨㄢ) are an indigenous people of Taiwan. They speak the Paiwan language. In 2014, the Paiwan numbered 96,334. This was approximately 17.8% of Taiwan's total indigenous population, making them the second-largest indigenous group.[2][3] The majority of Paiwan people live in the southern chain of the Central Mountain Range, from Damumu Mountain and the upper Wuluo River in the north of the southern chain to the Hengchun Peninsula in the south of it, and also in the hills and coastal plains of southeastern Taiwan. There are two subgroups under the Paiwan people: the Raval and the Butsul.[4] The unique ceremonies in Paiwan are Masaru and Maleveq. The Masaru is a ceremony that celebrates the harvest of rice, whereas the Maleveq commemorates their ancestors or gods. The name ""Paiwan"" may have originated from a myth. According to the myth, Paiwan ancestors lived in a location on Dawu mountain (Tawushan) that was called ""Paiwan"", where heaven is said to exist. Paiwan people have spread out from this location, so the name of the original place was assumed as their group name. According to some group members, ""Paiwan"" also means ""human being"".[4] One of the most important figures in Paiwan history was supreme chief Tok-a-Tok[5] (c. 1817–1874),[a][6] who united 18 tribes of Paiwan under his rule, and after defeating American Marines during the Formosa Expedition in 1867 he concluded a formal agreement with Chinese and Western leaders to ensure the safety of foreign ships landing on their coastal territories in return for amnesty for Paiwan tribesmen who had killed the crew of the barque Rover in March 1867 (see Rover incident).[7] In 1871, a Ryūkyūan vessel shipwrecked on the southern tip of Taiwan, and 54 of the 66 survivors were beheaded by the Paiwan indigenous (Mudan Incident). When Japan sought compensation from Qing China, the court rejected the demand on the grounds that Taiwan's ""raw"" or ""wild"" natives (Chinese: 臺灣生番; pinyin: Táiwān shēngfān) were outside its jurisdiction. This perceived renunciation of sovereignty led to the Japanese invasion of Taiwan in 1874 in which chief Tok-a-Tok was killed in action[citation needed]. During the Chinese Civil War, between 1946 and 1949, many Paiwan men were forcibly enlisted in the Kuomintang forces. When the war ended, some of the Paiwan remained behind in China and formed their own communities.[citation needed] Tsai Ing-wen, elected as President of Taiwan in 2016, is 1/4 Paiwan via her grandmother. In 2023 the skulls of four Paiwan warriors taken as trophies during the Japanese invasion of Taiwan in 1874 and transferred to the collection of the University of Edinburgh in 1907 were returned to the tribe.[8][9] Unlike other peoples in Taiwan, Paiwan society is divided into classes with a hereditary aristocracy. The Paiwan are not allowed to marry outside their group. On the day of their ""five-yearly rite,"" all marriage-seeking Paiwan men try to cut down as many trees as possible and offer the firewood thus procured to the family of the girl they want to marry. Tattooed hands are a tradition of both Paiwan and Rukai peoples. Noble women used to receive these tattoos as a rite of passage into adulthood. However, since the Japanese colonial era, the practice has been less common as it was discouraged and fined during that time. In the tradition, shamans would tattoo hands in different patterns for different personal backgrounds. Less noble women could have received it, but they had to pay a hefty price on top of inviting all members of the community to a banquet with the purpose of gaining the community's approval. Less noble women had different tattoo designs than noblewomen. The painful tattooing process represented dignity and honor and the suffering that one could endure. The tattooing process lasts as long as it needs to with consideration for many taboos and nuances, such as praying. For example, pregnant women were not allowed to watch the process and no one watching was allowed to sneeze. If any taboos were broken, the ritual would be put off until another day chosen.[10] In February 2015, Li Lin, the oldest Paiwan with hand tattoos, died at the age of 102. Li Lin had her hand tattoos starting at the age of 14 before marrying a village head as a common girl.[11] She played a large role in promoting the cultural art form and continues to be an icon of cultural identity even in her death.[12] Those of the indigenous Paiwan group have a unique kind of clothing scheme with details that differentiate societal class, gender, and ceremonies. Materials used for clothing started out as bark fibers and pelts, but linen, cotton, and wool fabrics later became popular. The men wear circular-collar long-sleeved short chest coverings with buttons down the front and kilts, and a shawl slung over the shoulder. Women of the indigenous group as well wear circular-collar robes but with buttons going down along their right side with panel skirts, and leggings. In addition, they wear head scarves, elaborate head rings, or forehead bands. In solemn ceremonies, Paiwan men wear ceremonial headwear, long vests, leg coverings, and sword baldrics. As for dance attire there is no difference in clothing, however it is common to wear one’s nicest clothes for special occasions. When children grew up and were about to get married, the mothers personally made their traditional clothing for them. Intricate and grand patterns, totems, and clothing are exclusively for nobles and the chief in the Paiwan group. Be it designs with human heads, human figures or hundred pace vipers, these patterns are used to decipher those of high class society from the rest of the members belonging to the group. The chief and others belonging to the high society of the Paiwan people also use tattoos to distinguish themselves, too. Commoners with special achievements are honored with tattoo(s) on their body and/or hands. Embroidery is popularly done with bright colors over dark, commonly black, backgrounds. Embroidery is important to the Paiwan people because it is used for Telling stories, sharing one’s memories, and legends/folktales. Hundred-pacer snakes, elements, and symbols such as the Sun and Sun god are used solely for the nobility. These represent and bring power to those who have these symbols. Designs with human heads and ancestral spirits signifies protection, while warriors and crossed-shaped patterns are symbols shamans can use to ward off evil. Patterns with hunting knives and animals are common as well, and when you see butterflies it is to symbolize innocent young girls, as flowers and grass are for ordinary people.[13][14][15] Traditionally the Paiwan have been polytheists. Their wooden carvings included images of human heads, snakes, deer, and geometric designs. In Taiwan, the Bataul branch of the Paiwan peoples holds a major sacrifice – called maleveq – every five years to invite the spirits of their ancestors to come and bless them. Djemuljat is an activity in the Maleveq in which the participants thrust bamboo poles into cane balls symbolizing human heads.[16] Shamanism has been described as an important part of Paiwan culture. Paiwan shamanism is traditionally seen as being inherited by blood-line. However, a decline in the number of Paiwan shamans has raised concerns that traditional rituals might be lost; and has led to the founding of a shamanism school to pass on the rituals to a new generation.[17] Thousands of Paiwan people in Taiwan converted to Christianity in the late 1940s and 1950s, sometimes whole villages. Today the Presbyterian church in Taiwan claims 14,900 Paiwan members, meeting in 96 congregations. The New Testament has been translated into Paiwan. The Catholic Church is also very active. The number of young people attending though is falling.[18] In May 2015, two Paiwan totem poles were listed as ROC national treasures by the Bureau of Cultural Heritage under the Ministry of Culture. Both of these artifacts were acquired by the National Taiwan University during the Japanese colonial period (1895–1945). They were submitted for national treasure listing earlier in 2015.[19] The Paiwan language is one of Taiwan's 42 indigenous tongues and dialects, being one of nine that are listed as vulnerable on the UNESCO atlas of endangered languages.[20]","This page was last edited on 28 November 2024, at 00:46 (UTC)."
Puyuma people,"The Puyuma (Chinese: 卑南族; pinyin: Bēinánzú; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Piu-má cho̍k, Pi-lâm cho̍k), also known as the Pinuyumayan, Peinan or Beinan, are one of the indigenous groups of the Taiwanese aborigines. The people are generally divided into the Chihpen and Nanwang groups, both resident in Taitung County on the east coast of Taiwan. In the year 2000, the Puyuma numbered 9,606. This was approximately 2.4% of Taiwan's total indigenous population, making them the sixth-largest indigenous group.[1] The Puyuma speak the Puyuma language, as well as Mandarin and Taiwanese Hokkien. The name ""Puyuma"" means ""unity"" or ""concord"" and was originally the autonym of the speakers of the Nanwang dialect.[2] Zeitoun and Cauquelin (2006) also note that the word Puyuma can be analyzed as pu'-uma, which means ""to send to the field"". The traditional clothing of the Puyuma people is a vibrant tapestry of colors, patterns, and distinctive garments that play an important role in expressing cultural identity and societal roles. The clothing is designed with a combination of red, yellow, and green hues, as well as black and white. It features a multi-layered diamond pattern resembling snake scales, accompanied by subtle cross-stitch designs for added detail.[3] Although most of the Puyuma people nowadays wear the western style clothes, traditional attire still predominates during significant holidays and festivals. The ethnic group's clothing varies across different age levels, with a more significant transition of clothes for men.[4] Boys and men, aged 13–21, wear simple attire during strict training, featuring a plain blue blouse and a short skirt tied with a red belt. Upon reaching marriageable age (over 22 years), they start to wear more attractive clothes to catch attention from women. They wear dark blue or black ensembles with cross-stitch patterns, a green belt, bells belt attached on the back, a sword worn at the waist, and a betel nut bag. Attire is then accessorized with glass beads or silver breast ornaments.[5] A white headscarf and crown of flowers sahaputan completes the look. In old age (60 years), men shift to a sleeveless waistcoat lumbaw and a square hat kabun, symbolizing their transition to the Elder category.[6] Women wear the same long-sleeved cropped bodice as men, except the color is bright blue or white. The bodice is paired with a bagelup, a small apron usually black (sometimes white) with a front embroidered pocket. In old age, the bagelup is replaced by the sugun, an apron tied at the waist with a pink belt. The lower attire then features a black underskirt with subtle embroidery, topped by an open skirt crossing on the left side, revealing inner skirt embroidery. Additionally, the lower part of the legs are covered with two rectangles of embroidered black cloth secured by four straps around the calves.[7] Women wear a variety of accessories, including silver bells, Japanese coins, bead headbands, silver hairpins, chest ornaments, silver and bead bracelets.[8] The crown of flowers mentioned in the context of men, remains an integral part of women’s attire, as well. Puyuma villages include (located in Beinan Township and Taitung City):[9]","This page was last edited on 26 November 2024, at 10:12 (UTC)."
Rukai people,"The Rukai (Rukai: Drekay) are one of the indigenous people of Taiwan. They consist of six communities residing in southern Taiwan (Budai, Labuan, Tanan, Maga, Mantauran, and Tona), each of which has its own dialect of the Rukai language. As of the year 2014, the Rukai numbered 12,699,[1] and is the seventh-largest of the 13 officially recognized indigenous groups in Taiwan. The Rukai were formerly called Tsarisen or Tsalisen, which means ""people living in the mountain"". The Rukai people honored the clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa) and the hundred pacer (Deinagkistrodon acutus), which they believe to be the spirit of their ancestor.[2][better source needed] The traditional dress of Rukai people has many similarities with that of the Paiwan people, probably due to the similarity of their geographical distribution and hereditary aristocratic social structure.[3]  The traditional dress and textile of the Rukai people also possesses original and distinctive qualities and characteristics.  Rukai people's dress include both ceremonial attire and casual wear.[4]  Men's ceremonial attire includes headwear with insignia, headscarves, tops, skirts, shawls, and leggings, while women wear garlands, headscarves, earrings, necklaces, lazurite necklaces, bead bracelets, arm rings, long gowns, skirts, girdles, leggings, and shoulder ornaments.[4]  In terms of casual wear, men wear leather headgear, headscarves, tops, shoulder straps, girdles, leather raincoats, deer hide coats, deer hide leggings, tobacco bags, and gunpowder bags, while women wear headscarves, long robes, skirts, leggings, gloves, mesh belts, leather raincoats, and cloth bags.[4]  Rukai social structure, hereditary aristocracy, is reflected in every facet of their lives, including attire. Generally, only the nobility are permitted to dress up and the commoners dress plainly and simply, although commoners can buy jewels from the nobility, usually bartering with pigs, millet, and pots. The nobility used to buy cotton, silk and woollen from the Han people to make clothes.[4] Like the traditional dress of all other indigenous groups in Taiwan, the traditional dress of Rukai people uses cloth made by the squared cloth system.[5] The main tool is the horizontal loom and the traditional material of the Rukai dress is linen, but under the influence of the Han people they have also begun using cotton and wool.[5]  Rukai people make linen from flax and use a horizontal loom with a strap to weave the linen into exquisite and beautiful cloth, and then sew pieces of cloth together to make garments.[6]  Making cloth is a duty particular to women in Rukai society, and when women are making cloth in a little house, men cannot enter.[5] Cloth is usually dyed red, yellow, brown, dark blue or green with dyes made from herbs or plants.[5]  The red colorant is extracted from the root of a specific vine by chopping the roots into pieces and soaking them in water.[5]  The yellow colorant usually comes from ginger root juice.[5]  The brown colorant comes from the Dioscorea matsudae, and is extracted with the same method used to make the red dye.[5]  The dark blue dye comes from the leaf juice of a plant called danadana, and the green colorant comes from the leaf juice of a plant called rasras.[5] Traditionally, the Rukai people's dresses were made entirely by hand, which required the meticulous and lengthy hand work of fine craftsmen. Even though nowadays it is becoming more and more common to use computer scanning programs to design the cut and style of the clothes, and apply the embroidery and other details mechanically, handmade embroidered garments remain the most valued kind of attire among the Rukai.[7] There are four essential manufacturing techniques: The patterns of the Rukai people's traditional dress include the sun, hundred pacer, snake, human head, human figure, string, pig, rhombus, and deer patterns, but the sun and the hundred pacer pattern are the most popular ones.[10]  The  rhombus pattern, which Rukai people regard as the symbol of the hundred pacer, is usually made with satin stitch embroidery.[8]  The anise star pattern, signifying holiness, is usually made with cross-stitch embroidery.[8]  Two sun patterns, considered a sign of the aristocracy, are normally embroidered on the breast area of the nobles’ dresses.[9]  The snake, human head, and human figure patterns are usually made with patch embroidery.[9] According to a Rukai informant in Wutai, Pingtung, the Rukai themselves did not practise headhunting, meaning they would specifically hunt their enemies' heads. Rather, when an enemy intruded into their living space, they would cut off their enemy's head, and then return to their village, carrying the head with them. This was the law of the land. However, they would not enter the village with the head, but rather take it to a special, nearby place where they would perform a solemn prayer. The head belonged to their enemy, but human life was special and needed to be respected. Though, the act of taking a head in defense of your tribe meant you were brave. The idea the Rukai intentionally attacked their enemies to take their heads, and hence that they were headhunters, is an issue the informant felt needs to be addressed.[citation needed] The government relocated several Rukai villages following the damage to southern Taiwan from Typhoon Morakot.[11]: 123  This mandated move threatened Rukai culture and prompted Rukai groups to begin community-based conservation programs to help local Rukai communities assert sovereignty over traditional lands.[11]: 123 ","This page was last edited on 26 November 2024, at 10:13 (UTC)."
Saaroa people,"The Saaroa or Hla'alua people (Chinese: 拉阿魯哇族) are an indigenous people of central southern Taiwan. They live in the two villages of Taoyuan and Kaochung in Taoyuan District, Kaohsiung and Maya Village in Namasia District, Kaohsiung.[1][2] The group attained official recognition from the Taiwanese government on 26 June 2014 under the name Hla'alua as the 15th indigenous people of Taiwan. Previously, the group as considered as subgroup of the Tsou people.[3] The Hla'alua tribe excels in hunting and tanning, developing leather crafts and products, and making leather clothing, and leather hats as a staple in men's attire. The formal dress for men includes a red long-sleeved top with a chest cover, a black short skirt, and a goat-skin hat. Women braid their hair with a scarf, wear a hat adorned with rooster feathers, and dress in a black skirt with a blue or white long-sleeved top featuring cross-stitch embroidery on the front panel. Other handicrafts, mostly practical items for daily life, hunting, rituals, and children's toys, are also prominent. Traditional gentlemen's attire includes shirts, hats, and pants made of goat or deer leather. The Hla'alua tribe embeds seashells on the front of leather hats and sews on five feathers (two eagle feathers on each side and a white tail feather from a Mikado pheasant in the center). Today, a red fabric top with tricolor stripes of yellow, green, white, green, and yellow on the back symbolizes family and tribal commitment. Women braid their hair with traditional scarves and wear hats adorned with rooster feathers. They wear black skirts with a blue or white long-sleeved top, and the women from Fliplara Village in Taoyuan often wear blue tops, while those from the communities of Paisiana, Talisia, and Bilangan in Gaozhong frequently opt for white tops. According to legend, they create hats with rooster feathers to commemorate the rooster and wear them to assist the tribe in negotiating with the sun.[4] This article about an ethnic group in Taiwan is a stub.

Saisiyat people,"The Saisiyat (Chinese: 賽夏; pinyin: Sàixià; Wade–Giles: Sai4 Hsia4; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: 獅設族(Sai-siat-cho̍k); lit. 'true people'; Hakka Pha̍k-fa-sṳ: 賽夏族(Sòi-hà-tshu̍k)), also spelled Saisiat, are an indigenous people of Taiwan. In 2000 the Saisiyat numbered 5,311, which was approximately 1.3% of Taiwan's total indigenous population,[1] making them one of the smallest aboriginal groups in the country. The Saisiyat inhabit Western Taiwan, overlapping the border between Hsinchu County and Miaoli County. They are divided into the Northern Branch (Wufong in the mountainous Hsinchu area) and the Southern Branch (Nanzhuang and Shitan in the highlands of Miaoli), each with its own dialect. Their language is also known as Saisiyat. Saisiyat are sometimes rendered as Saiset, Seisirat, Saisett, Saisiat, Saisiett, Saisirat, Saisyet, Saisyett, Amutoura, or Bouiok. A series of major conflicts between the Kingdom of Tungning and the Saisiyat people left the Saisiyat decimated and with much of their land in the hands of the Kingdom. The details of the conflicts remain mysterious however historians agree that the outcome was negative for the Saisiyat.[2] The first Aboriginal victim of the White Terror was Jih Chin-chun, a Saisiyat man executed in 1952.[3] The Saisiyat people hold a festival called Pasta’ay every two years.[4] In the ancient times, human beings were created by god and lived in the original land. Then a flood happened suddenly and human beings were dispersed everywhere without knowing what would happen. Then, a man sat on a weaving loom and floated to Airubia Mountain. There was a god called Otspoehobong (Oopenhaboon) on the mountains. The god grabbed the man suddenly. Fearing that the flood would cause human beings to be extinct, the god killed the survivor, pounded his flesh, chanted an incantation, and threw the flesh of the dismembered corpse into the sea. The flesh turned into human beings. They were our ancestors named Siasiat by the god. Then the god cut his intestines and threw into the sea. The intestines turned into human beings. They were the ancestors, of Taiwanese... Then it threw his bones into the sea. The bones also turned into human beings.

Sakizaya people,"The Sakizaya (native name: Sakuzaya, literally ""real man""; Chinese: 撒奇萊雅族; pinyin: Sāqíláiyǎ; occasionally Sakiraya or Sakidaya) are Taiwanese indigenous peoples with a population of approximately 1,000. They primarily live in Hualien (formerly known as Kiray), where their culture is centered.[1] The Sakizaya are an Austronesian people, mostly related to other Taiwanese indigenous peoples, and have cultural, linguistic, and genetic ties to other Austronesian ethnic groups, such as those from the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Madagascar, and Oceania.  The Sakizaya traditionally practiced ancestor worship, which includes the worship of a pantheon of gods and ancestral spirits. However, most have converted to Christianity. Their society is mostly matrilinear, and women often have the authority. On 17 January 2007, the Taiwan government recognized the community as a distinct ethnic group. Before this, the people was previously classified as Amis, the group where they ""hid"" after they, and their Kavalan allies, fought a devastating battle against Qing invaders during the late 19th century. Nationally Recognized Locally recognized Unrecognized Due to their intermingling within other peoples, the original genetic identity of the Sakizaya is uncertain. According to one study, they are intimately related to the Northern and Middle Amis.[2] They also seem to share certain genetic traits with other indigenous groups, as well as with the Taiwanese Han, though this may have been a result of intermarriage. The C2 and C3 haplogroups are absent in their population. Much of the history of the Sakizaya is unknown. It is unclear when the Sakizaya, or their ancestors, first arrived in Taiwan. According to some experts, the first human inhabitants of the island arrived 15,000 years ago and were dependent on marine life for survival.[3] Neolithic peoples began arriving 6,000 years ago, which allowed the advent of agriculture, domestic animals, polished stone adzes, and pottery.[3] The presence of these adzes imply a relation with the Penghu islands, where these objects are common.[3] The first contact with the community outside of Formosa occurred during the 17th century, when the Dutch and the Spanish arrived.[4] It was during this time when a 1636 Spanish document was written about the name and activities of the people.[5] Since then, there were not any reports of external contact until the 19th century. In 1878, the Sakizaya, and their Kavalan allies, fought a devastating battle against Qing invaders.[6] This event ended in disaster for both communities causing many of their members to be slaughtered in an event called the ""Takobowan incident [zh]""[4] (also known as the “Galeewan Incident”[7] or “Kalyawan Battle”).[2] Others were displaced by Han settlers.[7] The remaining Sakizaya, meanwhile, were forced to blend with other peoples, such as the Ami, with the intention of protecting their identity.[8] When the Japanese ruled Taiwan in 1895, anthropologists classified the people as a subgroup of the Amis.[9] The people, however, discreetly maintained their own culture and language which continued during the next century.[8] In 2004, the community presented a petition for official ethnic group status to the Council of Indigenous Peoples based on historical, linguistic and cultural data.[10] This was officially filed on 13 October 2005.[11] Eventually, the petition was approved on 17 January 2007, recognizing them as a distinct ethnic group.[10][12] Like other Taiwanese Aborigines, the Sakizaya face contemporary social and economic challenges.[13] These include urbanization of the youth, a phenomenon that may affect their culture.[14] The Sakizaya language was classified as a dialect of Nataoran Amis,[15][16] a Formosan language that belongs to the Austronesian language family.[15] However, the National Chengchi University opened the classification to debate, stating that Sakizaya remains 60–70 percent different from the Amis language despite the two groups living together.[5] Currently, there are about 2,000 speakers of the language.[5] The people also speak several other languages. These include languages spoken by the peoples where they have hidden such as Amis,[5] and Mandarin, the official language of the country.[17] The Sakizaya practice a variety of religions. These include traditional beliefs that mixes aspects of ancestor worship and animism.[18] Some may also practice Christianity.[19] The traditional religious beliefs of the Sakizaya are currently experiencing external pressures since many of the tribesmen may have converted to Christianity.[19] The threat is heightened by the increasing importance of Christianity to the community.[19] The people are known to practice ancestor worship.[5] They believe on a pantheon of ancestral spirits and deities known as dito, similar to the kawas of the Amis,[18] as well as the anito of the Filipinos. They are considered to be ""fickle as the weather""[18] so priests or mapalaway are necessary to communicate with them.[18] They are invisible to most people though they are known to wear red.[18] Several beliefs are associated with these spirits, such as pregnancy and death.[18] The homeland of the dito is Meilun Mountain in Hualien, which is also the place where the deceased pass through before finally resting in the sea.[18] The Sakizaya have several gods. A few examples include Malataw‧Otoki, the deity the spirit of the world, Olipong, the god that ""drives away illnesses"", and Talaman or Takonawan, the god of the poor.[18] An individual's personal dito become the god of death once they have died.[18] Rituals are practiced to appease the dito[18] and often resemble closely rituals performed by other Austronesian peoples.[20] The practice of these are dictated according to the seasons: spring or pasavaan, summer or ralod, fall or sadinsing, and winter or kasinawan.[20] An example of these is the Palamal or the ""Worship of the Fire God"".[4] According to a Japanese document, several rituals are associated with the main staples, millet or havay and dry rice or tipus.[20] These included the ""Millet Sowing Ritual"", ""Fishing Ritual"", ""Collecting Ritual"", ""Harvest Ritual"", and ""Storing Ritual"", which are all based on the growth of the millet.[20] Another religion practiced by some Sakizaya is Christianity. The religion first arrived in Formosa during the age of European colonization. Its formal arrival occurred in 1627, during the arrival of Georgius Candidius, the first ordained minister to set foot on the island.[21] According to this missionary, the conversion of the natives was effective.[21] The conversion was so successful that native clergymen soon became a necessity.[21] This success, however, was short-lived since Christians faced persecution after the arrival of the Chinese.[21] It was not until late in the 20th century that this religion began to achieve its resurgence.[19] Currently, almost 70 percent of Taiwanese Aborigines practice Christianity,[19] though the exact number of Sakizaya practicing this religion is uncertain. The religion has become effective in maintaining social unity,[19] which has been held by traditional practices. Only a few aspects of the Sakizaya's society and culture have been revealed. It is known that they have a matrilinear society. Women often have the authority in the household.[14] In terms of survival, fishing and hunting are important.[14] Rice cultivation also forms a significant aspect of their food production. This practice is thought to have been acquired through the Kavalan.[14] Millet is important as a food source and as a way in determining the occasions of festivals.[14] Headhunting was once prevalent[22] but has fallen out of practice.[23] The culture of the Sakizaya is under threat due to the small but steady urbanization of Sakizaya youth.[14] Efforts to preserve their culture have been initiated by the government,[24] which believes this could be beneficial to ecotourism.[24] The Sakizaya's traditional attire was initially very similar to the Amis people’s, since it was considered to be a part of the Amis tribe. Both tribes originally wore red clothing, but after the Cultural Revitalization Movement in 2007, the Sakizaya people redesigned their attire, incorporating elements from their history and legends to distinguish it from Amis clothing. They aimed to convey a new story using a variety of colors among which the most significant ones were: gold yellow for earth and homeland, light brown for identity, red for the historical battles and blue for peace and friendship with the Amis.[25] Sakizaya clothing consists of upper garments, vests, leg coverings, betel nut bags, and headgear. [26] Women's attire includes earthy gold vests and blood-colored inner robes, symbolizing mature women's responsibility for the land and family continuity. Unmarried girls wear mainly earthy gold without the dark red, representing childbirth.[27] The brown and green on the skirt and leg coverings represent branches, grass, and mud from their ancestors' clothes. This serves as a reminder of the challenges they faced when escaping from enemies.[28] Men's clothing continues the main colors of the ethnic group. The short vest-style tops highlight the strength and agility of the male warriors, The pants with a back panel skirt consisted mainly of blue, red and yellow colors and its main purpose of was just to allow easy movement.[29] During special celebrations long golden robes are also usually worn by important community leaders.[30] Regarding headgears, men and women headgears represent different cultural backgrounds. Men’s headwear symbolizes the heroic story of two tribesmen sacrificing their lives for the whole tribe by jumping into the flood. After the flood the triangular piece of snow-white marble rock was created on the Shabolu mountain, which is now a symbol on the men’s headwear.[31] Women headwear on the other hand represents the hardships in the battle of 1878, by incorporating dark red for bloodshed, oval flakes for execution, long tubes for thorny bamboo, white drops for tears, and green beads for tribal defense.[32] According to Japanese researchers, Sakizaya men are divided into age-class systems, known as sral, where they stay for about five years.[14] Between infancy and 15 years of age, boys are classed into the child class or wawa.[14] They soon participate in a ritual known as Masatrot and are trained in a youth-house or talaon, where they learn to obey orders as well as certain commands.[14] Once they accomplished this, they would move to the preparatory youth class or kapah and stay there until they are 23 years of age, when they finally reach the superior class.[14]","This page was last edited on 26 November 2024, at 10:16 (UTC)."
Seediq people,"The Seediq (sometimes Sediq, Seejiq, pronounced: [seˈʔediq], [səˈdiq], [səˈʔəɟiq]; Chinese: 賽德克族; pinyin: Sàidékèzú) are a Taiwanese indigenous people who live primarily in Nantou County and Hualien County. Their language is also known as Seediq. They were officially recognized as Taiwan's 14th indigenous group on 23 April 2008. Previously, the Seediq, along with the closely related Truku people, were classified as Atayal.[2] Starting from 1897, the Japanese began a road building program that brought them into the indigenous people's territory. This was seen as invasive. Contacts and conflicts escalated and some indigenous people were killed. In 1901, in a battle with the Japanese, indigenous people defeated 670 Japanese soldiers. As a result of this, in 1902, the Japanese isolated Wushe. Between 1914 and 1917, Japanese forces carried out an aggressive 'pacification' program killing many resisting people. At this time, the leader of Mahebo, Mona Rudao, tried to resist rule by Japan, but he failed twice because his plans were divulged. At his third attempt, he organized seven out of twelve groups to fight against the Japanese forces. When Japanese soldiers raped indigenous women, two leaders and twenty men killed thirteen Japanese soldiers.[3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10] After taking over the plain, Japanese gained control of Wushe. Some of the Tgdaya people who resisted the Japanese were shot. Because of this, fighting broke out again,[11][12][13] leading to the Wushe incident. In 1903 the Japanese launched a punitive expedition to seek revenge for their earlier loss at Renzhiguan.[14][15][16][17][18] The Japanese wanted to subjugate the Truku group. After eight years of investigating the area, they invaded in 1914. Two thousand of the indigenous people took part in resisting the invasion.[19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27] The Japanese deployed 200 machine guns and 10,000 soldiers against the Aboriginals, but grievous wounds were inflicted upon the Japanese Governor-General Sakuma Samata during the war and caused his eventual death.[28][29] The Musha Incident (Chinese and Japanese: 霧社事件 Chinese and Japanese: 霧社事件; pinyin: Wùshè Shìjiàn; Wade–Giles: Wu4-she4 Shih4-chien4; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Bū-siā Sū-kiāⁿ rōmaji: Musha Jiken), also known as the Wushe Rebellion and several other similar names, began in October 1930 and was the last major uprising against colonial Japanese forces in Japanese Taiwan. In response to long-term oppression by Japanese authorities, the Seediq indigenous group in Musha (Wushe) attacked the village, killing over 130 Japanese. In response, the Japanese led a relentless counter-attack, killing over 600 Seediq in retaliation. The handling of the incident by the Japanese authorities was strongly criticised, leading to many changes in aboriginal policy. The Seediq people featured prominently in the 2011 Taiwanese historical drama film Seediq Bale which depicted the 1930 Wushe Incident along with the earlier Renzhiguan and Zimeiyuan incidents.[30] The Wushe Incident was depicted three times in movies including in 1957 in the film 青山碧血 Qing Shan bi xue,[31] It was also depicted in the 2003 TV Drama Dana Sakura [zh]. The albums Seediq Bale (2007) and Takasago Army (2011) by Taiwanese extreme metal band Chthonic talk about the experiences of the Seediq people during the first half of the 20th century presented through fictionalized narratives.[32]","This page was last edited on 26 November 2024, at 10:17 (UTC)."

Taroko is also the name of the area of Taiwan where the Taroko reside. The Executive Yuan, Republic of China has officially recognized the Taroko since 15 January 2004. The Taroko are the 12th aboriginal group in Taiwan to receive this recognition. Previously, the Taroko and the related Seediq people were classified in the Atayal group.[2] The Taroko people demanded a separate status for themselves in a ""name rectification"" campaign. The Taroko resisted and fought the Japanese in the 1914 Truku War. The traditional attire of the Truku people is predominantly fashioned from linen, with wool and cotton also being viable materials. The intricate process of crafting garments, accessories, or bedding involves several stages, including spinning, bleaching, and warping. Subsequently, the tribe's women skillfully weave flax in diverse colors, primarily encompassing shades of green, yellow, red, black, and white as a foundational palette. Typically, men's attire consists of a sleeveless square jacket featuring a breast pocket. This square garment system incorporates long strips sewn into white ramie cloth. Two straps are affixed to both ends of the upper edge of the breast pocket, alongside two others on each side, facilitating fastening behind the neck and back. Chiefs and warriors distinguish themselves with shell clothes adorned with cylindrical shell ornaments. Women's common attire comprises a black headdress embellished with colorful diamond shapes, a vivid blue top, and a black skirt, secured with two strips around the breast and waist. Additionally, women have two black leggings on their calves and ankles. While variations in technique, style and texture exist across regions, the Truku people universally incorporate geometric lines and rhombus patterns as shared symbols aligned with their beliefs. Horizontal lines symbolize the path leading to the spiritual bridge, while the diamond pattern represents the ancestral spirit's vigilant eye, signifying protection. 3.  Official government[1] 4.

The Thao/Ngan people numbered around 800, making them one of the smallest of all of the recognized indigenous peoples in Taiwan (a number of indigenous peoples, both smaller and larger than the Thao in population, remain unrecognized by the Taiwanese government).[1] Despite their small group size, the Thao/Ngan have retained their customs, beliefs and traditional culture and language until now, though they have been assimilated into mainstream culture as well. Most of the members of this ethnic group work in the tourism industry at Sun Moon Lake. The Chi-Chi earthquake of 1999 damaged or destroyed 80% of the houses of the Thao/Ngan. The Thao/Ngan people have their own language, the Thao language, which is nearly extinct and spoken by only a few, mostly elders, of the (already small) Thao ethnic population. The language has been sinicized. Most people who speak Thao are bilingual or trilingual and can speak Mandarin Chinese and/or Taiwanese as well. The Thao/Ngan language is classified as a Northern Formosan language, which is a geographical subgroup of the much larger Austronesian language family. The Thao language has loanwords from the Bunun language, spoken by the Bunun ethnic group of which the Thao/Ngan cooperated with as well as intermarried. According to Thao oral history, the Thao people originally live in Chiayi, later moved to Alishan Range, before eventually settling around Sun Mun Lake as well as Lalu Island in the middle of the lake. According to the legend, they saw a deer and wanted to eat it, so they chased it until they arrived in the side of Sun Moon lake. Then the deer ran into the water, leaving the Thao by themselves. They could only wait. The Thao people then slept at Sun Moon Lake. One of the elders dreamed of a fairy in a white cloak. He said to them ""I am the deer that led you here. This place is your promised land. Please don't leave, because generations will come."" The Thao clothing style is known for its use of geometric patterns, and its use of brown, blue, gray and black. The dagobun is a famous Thao clothing, made of a cloth knitted with flax yarn and dog fur. Women’s traditional clothing mainly consists of a head scarf, a sleeved blouse, a corset, a waist skirt, a belt, knee breeches, and a crown made of flowers and plants. The head scarf used to be made of black cotton, but it is now more commonly made of red and black strips of cloth, with sequins and pearls sewn onto it. Small beaded tassels are hanging from the sideburns, with a belt fastened to the back of the head. The corset is a one-piece garment that functions as a skirt and is made of two rectangular pieces of cotton that reach to the knees and are fastened diagonally to each other over the left and right shoulders, and then tied with a belt. Men’s traditional clothing consists of headgear, headwear, chest wear, vest, skirt, breech-less trousers, and leather shoes. It is made of leather, linen and bark. On 15 August 2001, the Executive Yuan (Council) of Taiwan officially recognized the Thao/Ngan as the tenth ethnic group among Taiwan's Indigenous peoples. The Thao have been mistakenly regarded as the ""Tsou"" (a separate and different ethnic group of Aboriginals) since the time of Japanese occupation. The error was caused by both a misunderstanding of the legend saying that ""the ancestors of Thao were from the mountain Alishan (Mountain A Li)"" and the similar pronunciation of ‘Thao/Ngan’ and ‘Tsou’. Thus, the domain of the Thaos/Ngans had been registered as ""Tsous from the flatlands of the mountains"" under the nine ethnic groups of Taiwan’s Indigenous peoples.","This page was last edited on 26 November 2024, at 10:20 (UTC)."
Tsou people,"The Tsou (Tsou: Cou; Chinese: 鄒; pinyin: Zōu; Wade–Giles: Tsou) are an indigenous people of central southern Taiwan. They are an Austronesian ethnic group. They reside in Chiayi County and Nantou County. The Tsou numbered around 6,000, approximately 1.19% of Taiwan's total Indigenous population, making them the seventh-largest indigenous group.[1] They are sometimes confused with the Thao people of Sun Moon Lake. The Tsou are traditionally based in the Alishan area. Their rich oral histories describe migrations of each ancient clans' ancestors into the area between Yushan and the Chianan Plain. Originally, each clan had its own settlement, with the first multi-clan town, Tfuya, forming approximately 1600 CE.[2] The earliest written record of the Tsou dates from the Dutch occupation, which describes the multi-clan settlement Tfuya as having approximately 300 people in 1647. Ethnologists have attempted to reconstruct the development of Tfuya, proposing that each stage of clan migration could be equivalent to three or four generations of family.[2] Another Formosan group of Bunun origin called the Takopulan reportedly lived in the same area, but were absorbed by the Tsou. Their largest settlement had 450 people in 1647. During the Japanese colonial period, four Tsou groups were recorded: Tfuya, Tapangᵾ, Imucu and Luhtu.[2] The traditional attire of the Tsou people is made of leather for men and cotton, silk, or brocade for women. The feathers on the leather hat symbolize the bravery of men. Common colors include red, white, black, and blue, with red being particularly common for men. Red is a crucial color in the traditional attire of the Tsou tribe, symbolizing courage, strength, and vitality. It is often prominent in the clothing of men and may serve as a symbol for warriors or leaders. Blue signifies the sky and sea, representing peace and harmony. It may also symbolize a connection and empathy with nature. Gentleman's attire includes fur hats, chest covers, long-sleeved jackets, fur vests, fur leg covers, and fur shoes. The hat holds significant meaning, as wearing a fur hat symbolizes an adult who is prepared to take on responsibilities for the tribe and family. When dressing up, men adorn their hats with feathers from eagles, Taiwan blue pheasants, Mikado pheasants, or condors to symbolize their courage. Women's attire comprises a black scarf, chest cover, long-sleeved jacket, dress, and leggings. The Tsou dress code is associated with age and social status.Leaders and warriors in the tribe may adorn themselves with special decorations. Warriors, chiefs and marshals can add a red decorative band with pearls, jade, and seashells to the front of their hats. The red color symbolizes courage and strength in Tsou culture, emphasizing the dignity of leaders and warriors. In addition to copper bracelets and arm ornaments, those who have hunted wild boars can wear bracelets with wild boar tusks.[3]","This page was last edited on 26 November 2024, at 10:21 (UTC)."
Tao people,"The Tao people (Chinese: 達悟族; pinyin: Dáwùzú) are an Austronesian ethnic group native to the tiny outlying Orchid Island of Taiwan. They have a maritime culture, with great ritual and spiritual significance placed on boat-building and fishing. Their ways of life have been threatened by the continued emigration to the mainland of Taiwan in search of jobs and education. As a result, the continuation of past traditions has been hindered. Despite being linked to both other Taiwanese indigenous peoples and Batanic indigenous Filipino populations, the Tao people remain unique in their customs and cultural practices.[1][2] The Tao people have been more commonly recorded under the exonym ""Yami people"" by official documents and academic literature, following Japanese anthropologist Torii Ryuzo's coining of the name in 1897. However, as a collective, these Orchid Island inhabitants typically prefer ""Tao people"" as their group identifier. Recently, they have successfully petitioned the Council of Indigenous Peoples of the Taiwanese government to use the name ""Tao"" in place of ""Yami"".[1][3] Citing threats to their culture and health, the Tao people have protested against the nuclear waste plant constructed on their island by the government in 1982 and advocated for its removal.[4] The Tao people are Austronesians, like other Taiwanese indigenous peoples. However, it is still unknown how they settled Orchid Island and from where. Unlike other indigenous Taiwanese groups, they speak a Western Malayo-Polynesian language and are presumed to be more closely related to the ethnic groups of the Philippines, particularly the Ivatan people. A common theory tracing their ancestry posits that their ancestors left the Batanes Archipelago in the Philippines, and settled Orchid Island approximately 800 years ago.[5] This reasoning is based primarily on the language similarities of the Ivatan and the Tao people. Also, it appears that these two groups traded goats, pigs, weapons, and gold until about 300 years ago due to continuous warfare.[5] A 2011 genetic study found that the Tao people are more genetically closely related to the other Taiwanese indigenous peoples in the Taiwanese mainland than to the Ivatan people of the Philippines. However, the Tao and the Ivatan both speak closely related Western Malayo-Polynesian languages and there is evidence of limited gene flow between the groups. The authors concluded that Orchid Island was settled independently from Taiwan during the early period of the Austronesian expansion (approximately 4000 BP), and not from the Batanes Islands as previous believed. Long-term trade contacts and limited intermarriage resulted in strong cultural and linguistic exchanges between the groups in subsequent millennia.[6] In addition to the Tao people of Orchid Island, there is a growing population of ethnic Chinese/Han Taiwanese individuals. This adds approximately 1,000 people to the number of inhabitants on the island.[7] The word Tao simply means ""person""/""human"" in the language of the Tao people.[8] The word Yami (meaning ""north"") originated from Japanese ethnologist Torii Ryūzō. He used the term to refer to the culture and language of the Tao people.[9] In recent years, some Tao people have rejected the name, but opinion remains divided.[10] While this indigenous group identifies collectively by the name Tao or Yami, individual communities on the island affiliate with unique names tied to their locality.[11] The language of the Tao people can be referred to simply as Tao or Yami. Natively, it is referred to as ciriciring no tao (""speech of human beings""). It is a Malayo-Polynesian language, a subgroup of Austronesian languages. More specifically, it is considered a Western Malayo-Polynesian language, one of two primary branches in the Austronesian subgroup—the other being Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian. The Tao language is a member of the Batanic languages and are grouped together with the Ivatan and Itbayat languages of the Philippines. As of 1994, there were a total of 3,000 speakers, and 3,255 individuals deemed ethnically Tao.[3][12] Orchid Island (Chinese: 蘭嶼; pinyin: Lányǔ; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Lân-sū) is known by the Tao people as Pongso no Tao (""island of human beings""), Irala (""facing the mountain""), or Ma'ataw (""floating in the sea"").[3] It is located approximately 40 miles off the southeastern coast of Taiwan, and directly north of the Batanes Islands of the Philippines.[9] It is a small island of about 45 square kilometers with an estimated total population of 4,000 inhabitants.[7][13] It was originally referred to as Hongtou Island (Red Head Island) by the Han Chinese; however, it was officially renamed Orchid Island in 1947 for its rich orchid produces.[14] There are very few plains on the island; instead, its geography is composed of steep mountains and hilly terrain. Most villages are located at mountain bases, because river run-off is an ample source of fresh water.[9] In 1877, the Qing dynasty claimed Orchid Island as part of its Chinese empire, but was unable to rule effectively. The island was ceded to Japan along with Taiwan in 1895.[13] Japan's rule of the island lasted from 1895 to 1945.[7] During this time, the government declared the island off limits to outsiders, and deemed it an ethnological research area. The Japanese government heavily monitored any outside influence that might drastically interfere with the Tao people's ways of life.[13] As a result, the Tao culture remains the best-preserved out of all Taiwanese indigenous peoples. Following Japan's defeat in World War II, the Republic of China took control of Orchid Island in 1945.[8] Tourism was introduced to the island in 1967, leading to increasing modernization among the Tao people.[7] Due to Westernization, their indigenous beliefs have melded with Christian practices. As a result, they have a belief system made of components from ancestral beliefs and Christian ideologies.[15] Ancestral Tao belief systems consisted of several layers, each host to a variety of gods and spirits. The first layer is home to the main god, Simo-Rapao, who oversees all other gods. According to Tao mythology, he created the Earth's first two individuals from a piece of rock, and a piece of bamboo. He doles out punishment, and is responsible for all natural calamities that affect the island. Sio-Mima is native of the second layer of the Tao cosmogony. He is believed to control the rest of the world, deemed dominated by white people. The third level is home to Si-Toriao and Si-Lovolovoin. Si Toriao allegedly controls the rain and lightning, while Si-Lovolovoin serves as a messenger to all of the gods. In the final layer of their ancient religious belief system resides the malevolent gods who may punish the Tao peoples with invasions of caterpillars and locusts.[16] Ancestral Tao people believed that goddesses were responsible for the birth of their children. According to their lore, there were separate goddesses for each gender. These goddesses dictated the births and lifetimes of the Tao populace. The length of an individual's life was determined by cracking a coconut and the measurement of the outpouring juice.[15] While their ancestral religious system was based on the dictation of gods, the Tao people rarely adhere to such a stringent belief system today. Instead, their belief system is intermixed with components of Christianity and remnants of their beliefs past. Today, many Tao people have converted to a Christianity (especially branches of Catholicism and Protestantism).[16] However, much of their traditional Christian ideologies are muddied with adherence to ancient superstitions. The Tao people greatly fear anito, the collection of evil spirits, even more than they worship an omnipotent God.[15] They believe that when an individual passes away, his or her soul travels to Malavang a Pongso, the White Island, while the rest of the minor souls from within become anito. As a result of this belief, they have an uncontrollable fear of the dead.[16] When a Tao individual is near death, relatives and friends stand beside his or her deathbed in full battle regalia in order to fight off evil spirits. Once the funeral has commenced, attendees catch crab and fish to be cooked and eaten on that day in remembrance of the deceased.[15] There is no specific ceremony for the entrance into adulthood. A boy is considered an adult when he reaches the ages of 18 or 19, and a girl is considered an adult when she turns 16 or 17.[15] A Tao man is deemed eligible for marriage when he participates in a fishing team, and can accomplish his fishing duties on his own. For women, they have to be proficient at taro cultivation and fabric weaving. Once the two parties are of marrying capabilities, relatives of both families formally propose to the woman's parents through the giving of presents. If her parents accept these offerings, they equivocally accept the proposal.[15] The Tao people are the only Taiwanese indigenous people with a maritime culture.[17] The Tao peoples divide their year into three separate fishing seasons: rayon, teyteyka, and amyan. Rayon is equivalent to spring, and spans from February to May. This is considered to be flying fish season, during which the men catch fish for ceremonial use. Teyteyka lasts from June to October, and signifies the end of the period of time in which flying fish can be caught on the surface. Finally, the amyan season signifies the time of year spent waiting for the flying fish to return. This season lasts from November to January. During the latter two seasons, fish cannot be caught for ceremonial use.[18] During these off seasons, the Tao people are charged with producing goods and recreation. Fishing is the main way in which Tao men can make a living on the island.[9] A crucial component of Tao life centers upon the building of their fishing boats. As a device used for their sole method of securing sustenance and monetary gain, they place great emphasis on the production of these boats. They make their boats using multiple wooden planks shaped with an ax. Due to their boats not being made from a single tree trunk or log, they cannot be considered canoes. They join the wooden planks together with dowels and rattan. Once they have successfully constructed the boat, they carve patterns and paint them using the traditional red, white, and black. They then adorn the bow and stern of the boat with chicken feather decorations. The hull of the boat typically consists of three main patterns: human figure, eye of the boat, and waves. The human figure symbolizes heroism through the representation of the earliest Tao man. The eye of the boat consists of a variety of concentric circles edged with triangles. Their composition represents the sun's rays, and is considered to ward off evil spirits that may cause disasters at sea.[18] They typically make boats to seat 1–3 people, 6 people, 8 people, or 10 people. However, no matter the size of the boat, the shape remains consistent.[15] The bow and the stern of the boat are both steep, upward arcs that allow for stability and sharp turns. They consider a boat an extension of man's body, and thus boat building is deemed a sacred mission. For the Tao, boat building is the ultimate creation of beauty.[9] Once the building of the boat is completed, the boat's owner will host a large launching ceremony. To celebrate, Tao women wear their agate beads necklaces and octagonal wooden hats a few days prior to the actual event. On the actual day of the launching ceremony, the Tao people gather and slaughter pigs as sacrifice, and the boat owner offers meat and taro to all of the families in his community. The men, dressed in traditional garb, circle the launching boat performing ceremonial rituals to ward off evil spirits before sending it into the water. They also throw the boat in the air several times prior to launch. The ceremony is deemed complete once the boat has remained afloat.[18] Those of the Yami tribe have traditional clothing with designs described as belonging to the more simpler side, unlike many other surrounding local indigenous tribes of Taiwan. Fibers of the flax plant and banana leaf, but then later more commonly cotton, were used to create clothes of white, black, and navy colors. Due to the indigenous group having no head and/or class system, clothing was equal amongst the people, even those who were technically more personal wealth than others.  Women wore pair square-clothed shirts accompanied by a short skirt. It would be common to see a woman with a large piece of cloth that has four longitudinal strips of white, black, or navy blue sewn together. Short skirts have three white and black or navy blue longitudinal stripes at each end while five or six-year-old girls wear only one piece. Men wear loincloths, vests and T-bands on their upper body. Jackets have white, black, or navy stripes on the front and back. A common men’s vest design would consist of white nylon fabric with five white and eleven navy horizontal lines woven with navy cotton thread clamp, and the whole garment is hemmed with white nylon thread and two plastic buttons at the front inner waist. T-bands are woven black or navy at both ends.[19][20] For special or ceremonial occasions, men and women wear blue and white vests in addition to vibrant accessories, such as an octagonal wooden hat for women, and silver helmets for men. During funerals and times of mourning, women wear their upper garments inside out, and men wear a piece of cloth, reverse side out, on their heads. It is also considered taboo to wear clothing with an odd number of blue or black stripes. Therefore, clothing patterns typically consist of 8 to 12 stripes.[18] Neither in ritualistic or everyday situations do the Tao people wear shoes.[15] The Tao peoples' production methods are divided into two primary categories: agriculture and fishing. Due to taro's ability to grow in a wide array of climates, it is a vital part of the Tao diet. The Tao people plant taro on the narrow coastal plains, and thus their diet consists of wetland taro and taro sweet potatoes. Their food is divided into two groups: kanen and yakan. Kanen is considered an entrée similar to rice, and yakan is deemed a side dish. Women are charged the task of collecting and cooking the kanen, while men are supposed to search for the yakan.[9] A crucial aspect of the Tao daily diet is seafood. While men are primarily charged with fishing duties, women are responsible for gathering shells, seaweed, and smaller fish from holes along the shore. The men practice both spear and net fishing as means for sustenance. All fish is categorized as either rahed or oyod. Rahed fish is deemed bad, and thus only eaten by the men. The oyod fish is considered the real fish and can be eaten by both men and women.[16] The Council of Indigenous Peoples is a Taiwanese cabinet-level government body that serves the needs of the country's indigenous populations.[21] The Tao people are one of sixteen aborigine populations represented by the council. The Tao people have no formal hierarchical structure. When disputes arise, the involved families are called upon to resolve the situation. Social affairs are governed by the male heads of families and members of the fishing community.[21] In 1967, the Taiwanese government stepped in to provide the Tao people concrete homes, an act which the aboriginal community deemed an affront to their culture.[5] However, most Tao live in these homes now with the addition of open-air pavilions.[5] Due to the island's relative remoteness, it lacks the equivalent infrastructure in transportation, health care or education in comparison to the main island.[9] However, in 2007 an official of the Council of Indigenous Peoples stated that it would raise its budget to help the aboriginal groups of Taiwan.[2] The Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) completed construction of Orchid Island's nuclear waste storage facility in 1982.[22] The facility houses waste from Taiwan's three operating nuclear power plants. Since its construction, 98,700 barrels of waste have been deposited on the island.[22] Since its construction, the storage facility has been met with opposition. Due to language barriers, the Tao people were not aware that a nuclear storage facility was being erected on their island. During its construction, workers told the islanders that they were building a food cannery that would help the local economy.[4] In 1987, when the Tao people finally learned of the dangers of nuclear waste, they began protests that lasted for more than twenty years. In the decades since the storage facility was constructed, there have been reports of increased cancer rates.[22] In 2007, Taipower promised to remove all nuclear waste by 2016.[23] On 22 November 2019, the government awarded $2.55 billion NTD ($83.6 million USD) to Orchid Island residents as compensation for the nuclear waste storage facility, which was determined to have been constructed without their knowledge or consent.[24]","This page was last edited on 28 November 2024, at 19:58 (UTC)."
